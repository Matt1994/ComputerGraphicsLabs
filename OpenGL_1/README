Main Modifications:

Aside from the initialisation of the OpenGL code, we also did the following:

- 2 new structs have been added: Vertex and Shape
    - Vertex contains the vertex data; location and colour
    - Shape contains the data for each shape:
        - The VAO and VBO
        - The Model Transform matrix
        - The Translate vector
        - A malloc'd array of vertices
        - The number of vertices
        - A function to rotate the shape

- Each shape is defined in the MainView constructor
    - The number of vertices are assigned, the vertices array is allocated 
      and and the translate vector is assigned
    - Each vertex is added to the vertices array
    - The Model matrix is translated by the translate vector

- Rotation and Scaling have been implemented
    - Rotation
        - Each shape has it's model matrix set back to the identity
        - The translate and previous scaling is set back to how it was
        - The model matrix is then rotated by the amount stated by the dials
    - Scaling
        - To ensure the scaling works properly, we first calculate the relative
          change in scale by dividing the new value by the old value. The old 
          value is stored in MainView
        - We then apply this to the model matrix
        - We update the current scale value to the new value shown on the slider
